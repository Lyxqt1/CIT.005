Some centuries ago in the highlands of Zamboanga lived the lovers Pulong and Maryam. Pulong was a Subanen and Maryam a Muslim and the difference in the lovers’ ethnic backgrounds did not sit well especially with the girl’s family`
-> muslim have a strict tradition when choosing their spouses.
-> most likely a tausug which means people of the current

Although a datu, Pulong never managed to win the favor of Maryam’s family, who did everything to separate the two. 
-> Pulong has the highest position of their tribe

When Maryam’s brother discovered her gone, he roused the whole village and everyone joined in on the search.
-> High family class in tausug can gather up people from the village

They combed through the mountains and the rivers until the lovers were eventually located.
-> since subanen are usually near the rivers


It is believed that the cries of Pulong and Maryam can be heard by the cliff until today.
-> tausug believes in spirits.
