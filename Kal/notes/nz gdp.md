we want to show you the effects of the pandemic, COVID-19 to New Zealand's GDP.
so at Dec - 2019, there still no confirmed cases. as soon as the first quarter of 2020 enters, cases of COVID are showing and
New Zealand immediately implemented lockdown to their borders which shows in the graph that their growth was slowed but they were able to go back in the rythm as the world able to control it in eventually.

next we wanted to show predictions to their total GDP for the next ten years. we used Linear regression, the yellow one, for total GDP's  near linear growth as shown in the graph with an r-squared equals to 0.98
Logarithmic regression was also used for its lower bound. having a higher and lower bound  are need for these kind of economic projections.

the top 5 least and most valuable industries. as we can see, printing industry is last and declining due to the fact that social media exists. New Zealand has been inclined to invest more to professional, scientific and technical services which is parallel to our evolution with tech.

as we can see, the top 4 assets are actual buildings and are called tangible assets. coming fifth is computer software which is an intangible asset. we think it is a good idea to support and invest more to computer software every nation needs to adapt to ever-evolving technology.

at the last two tables, we will see which sector of new zealand produces and consumes more.
the private sector is the largest consumer as well as the largest producers.
the central government comes second for both consumption and production
and the least are the local government.
