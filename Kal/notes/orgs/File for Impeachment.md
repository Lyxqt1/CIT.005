	1. failed to reserve mpcc2 - Erica covered it up and was able to use mpcc2 during friday(prep) and saturday
	2. He left early during the preparations. meanwhile everyone else went home really late
	3. 

not his responsibility as a governor to reserve venues and make job orders yet he volunteered in doing so yet most of them are not properly reserved.

He failed to comply to the system and thus delegation of task are all over the place.
The gov is not left out; He has the position to keep up with the other execs
