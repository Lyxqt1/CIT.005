The moon was beautiful isn't it?
The warmth of sunrise on my skin
But I am falling asleep
then woke up from our slumber

The moon is still beautiful isn't it?

fuck. breakdown ba to. idk. I wanna calm down. lessen the overthinking  and the anxiety. yes I am breathing normally. I'll share you this letter to you someday. soon.

Idk where to start. I know why I am having this. It's my trauma. 

before I go into that. I just wanna express how I am supeeeeer grateful and happy with you. I really want to let you know I feel this time, that's why I am writing it.

around summer of 2022, I met someone. naging kame within a day. she's the one who initiated it. it was fine until she said that she was unsure. nevertheless, I never stopped. but we continued as friends with "romantic feelings" so to say. I even went to their place. somewhere in luzon. Then at some point, she became dry in her replies, eventually she never responded for five days. at that point, I ended it. It was sad, but I already moved on. 

on the same week, someone from another school in zamboanga confessed to me. I was so desperate for certain thing. I didn't commit but I expected a lot from that but same ending with the previous one and we never actually met. 

then, a schoolmate, my friend set us up. we chatted and clicked. in just a span of days, we discussed "commitments" with each other. But, it ended pretty fast. She still into her ex.



I was seeking a significant other for a certain thing. that is, never be too scared to share dumb things with her HHAHA. the comfort of being accepted and loved unconditionally. 


but, the traumas. of me being left behind. alongside with my so-called the big sadness



I probably know what's bothering with me right now. I also am scared from my past, of being left behind. I am scared, of me not making everything between us special. I know you're really sorry about your past, I accept you and I really love love love you. I just need a sense of calmness and security, and peace of mind. I am scared of you getting hurt. seriously, I wanna do a lot of things with you but it might bring up something, that's really bothering me. It's difficult to overthink of me doing something for you that will remind you something from the past :ccc

I do not know, I know I am overthinking but I really want you to know that I really really scared sometimes. I trust you a lot bb, I love you a lot. I wanna keep and stay with you forever.
