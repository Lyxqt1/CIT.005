1. What was MY UTMOST REALIZATION, with regards to improving my health and fitness, this time, BY ENGAGING IN THE ETHNIC DANCE I STUDIED? And why?

(Relate this also to the health/ fitness components/ fitness value of the dance you studied)

First of all, I really thought that this dance would be a little bit easier to perform since It was mostly focused on the footwork. However, this performance was actually more difficult than previous one and caused faster strain and fatigue to my body compared to the last one. During the recording of my video, I actually tried hard to control well my breathing and manange my stamina.

2. What were the CHANGES THAT MANIFESTED IN ME while studying and doing this dance?

(Cite important points and also experiences with regards to what you felt, saw, or thought while studying and doing the dance)

While trying to learn this dance, I learned that our different cultures and also their culture itself is really diverse and colorful. I feel proud to their works of art and culture. Although, it is quite sad when only a few people are intersted to these such things nowadays

3. After performing a traditional dance, how do I SPEAK ABOUT IT NOW? As an enlisted domain of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, how can these dances become a strong FORCE IN THE PRESERVATION, PROMOTION, PROPAGATION, and PROTECTION OF OUR PHILIPPINE DANCE HERITAGE? (a part of being fit socially, emotionally, and spiritually leading to cultural literacy and excellence)

This is just not a dance or performance, it is a way to show what a strong you are. It really requires a lot of stamina to perform this smoothly. We Filipinos, are encouraged to study these traditional dance in order to preserve, promote, propagate and protect our dance heritage

4. As the choreographer of this piece, what was MY MOST SIGNIFICANT LEARNING in staging and performing a traditional dance? And why?

Firstly breathe, you need that in order to survive atleast 2 minutes and 30 seconds dancing Tumahik. Secondly, practice and master the dance so that the performer will not lose it tracks. And, Do the steps strongly and show it with force at the same time conserving the performers' energy

5. As I end my journey in PATHFIT, HOW DO I ASSESS MYSELF NOW WITH THE FITNESS ACTIVITIES I ENGAGED IN AT THIS TIME OF PANDEMIC? How did it help me COPE WITH STRESS and/ or ALLEVIATE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES/ CONCERNS Iâ€™ve experienced in the past two years? How did IT HELP ACHIEVE BEING FIT AT THESE TIMES? And Why?

As I end our last PATHFIT course in college, for sure this will be a quite of a memory to look back at some point in the near future. As I assess myself physically, In my opinion my physical fitness is quite good but nothing really exceptional. I somehow cope the stress when I feel my calves burning and I usually do bike rides frequently. Feeling my legs getting worked up and my stamina being consumed helped quite gain some strength I suppose.
