To Ma'am Baguio
I, Prince John Carlo Austria of BS CS - 2, from the GE ELECT Lit-Min, would not be able to attend my classes face-to-face from 20th to 24th of June. I would like to attend the missed face-to-face classes via video conference using zoom or discord with the help of my classmates Olegaria and Yu. 

I am not able to attend the said dates because I am going out-of-town for family gatherings in Manila.
